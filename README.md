#  Healthcare Management System (HMS)

A **blockchain-powered healthcare management system** built on **Polygon L2**, designed to securely store and manage patient records. It enables **role-based access** for **patients, hospitals, and administrators**, ensuring **privacy, transparency, and immutability** using **smart contracts and IPFS**.

##  Features

-  **Decentralized Healthcare Data Management**
-  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
-  **Immutable Medical Records Stored on IPFS**
-  **Smart Contract-Driven Data Sharing Approvals**
-  **Optimized for Cost Efficiency & Scalability using Polygon L2**
-  **EIP-712 Signature Verification for Secure Transactions**

## ðŸ“Œ Why Blockchain in Healthcare?

Healthcare data is **highly sensitive** and requires **robust security**. Traditional systems are prone to **breaches, lack transparency, and face centralization issues**. Blockchain technology provides:

- **Immutability**: Data cannot be altered once recorded.
- **Transparency**: All actions are logged and verifiable.
- **Security**: Ensures only authorized access to patient data.
- **Interoperability**: Seamless data exchange across multiple healthcare providers.
